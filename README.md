# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Using Time Series Models

This Google Colab notebook implements and compares four popular time series forecasting models for predicting cryptocurrency prices:

- **ARIMA** ‚Äì a classic statistical model for stationary series.
- **Holt-Winters (Exponential Smoothing)** ‚Äì uses trend and seasonality to model recurring patterns.
- **Facebook Prophet** ‚Äì robust at automatically detecting trends and seasonal components.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** ‚Äì a deep learning model capable of capturing nonlinear dependencies.

üìÖ **Forecast Range**: The models predict cryptocurrency prices for the next **90 days** using historical data from **June 1, 2023 to June 1, 2025** retrieved from **Yahoo Finance**.
